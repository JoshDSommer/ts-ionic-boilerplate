# ts-ionic-boilerplate
An attemp  to create a starter template for ionic and typscript, with gulp setup and ready to go along with the nessary d.ts files I'm using visual studio code

in the project root directory:

1) setup sass for ionic

`ionic setup sass`

2) setup gulp-typscript

`npm install gulp-typescript`

you will need to install install gulp-tyscript which allows gulp to build form the tsconfig.json file, the gulp config is already setup.
